## Hello there 👋

I'm Gavin, an 8th grader, delving into the deep world of
computer science and electrical engineering.

I code and build whatever my heart desires and often
help solve my friend's problems using ⭐ technology ⭐.

I have a background and fundamentals in flutter, html, css, react js, js, python, and java.

I've been working on transparency, an app to help solve addictions with lust, and also delving
into the world of transformers, neural nets, and other cool machine learning stuff. Also, I've 
been working on electrical engineering projects.
